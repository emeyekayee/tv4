  # (SchedResource protocol) Returns a hash where each key is a SchedResource
  # id (rid, here, a channel number) and the value is an array of Events
  # (program showings) in the interval <tt>t1...t2</tt>, ordered by
  # <tt>starttime</tt>.
  #
  # What <em>in</em> means depends on *inc*.  If inc(remental) is
  # false, client is building an interval from scratch.  If "hi", it is
  # an addition to an existing interval on the high side.  Similarly
  # for "lo".  This is to avoid re-transmitting blocks that span the
  # current time boundaries on the client.
  #
  # Here the resource is a station (indicated by its channel number) and
  # the use blocks are events.
  #
  # ==== Parameters
  # * <tt>rids</tt> - A list of scheduled resource ids (strings).
  # * <tt>t1</tt>   - Start time.
  # * <tt>t2</tt>   - End time.
  # * <tt>inc</tt>  - One of nil, "lo", "hi" (As above).
  #
  # ==== Returns
  # * <tt>Hash</tt> - Each key is a <tt>rid</tt> (here, channel number)
  # and the value is an array of Programs in the interval, ordered by
  # <tt>starttime</tt>.
